# DesignPatterns

A simple and neat repository containing a few examples of the most well-known and widely-used Design Patterns in Java.

## Why this repo?

After reading [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) by the GoF I though it would have been useful (as a Java programmer) to try to implement each designe pattern after studying it on a book.

## How it works

- First you'll have to clone this repo.
- In the src/main/java folder you will find a package named after each design pattern implemented (e.g. \**/com/lucafontanili/designpatterns/abstractfactory/*\*).
- In each design pattern folder you'll find a Client class that implements the *main* method (thus can be executed). Each Client is named following the naming convenction DesignPatternNameClient (e.g. *AbstractFactoryClient*)

**Have fun**

# DesignPatterns

A simple and neat repository containing a few examples of the most well-known and widely-used Design Patterns in Java and Python.

## Why this repo?

After reading [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) by the GoF I though it would have been useful (as a back end developer) to try to implement each design pattern after studying it on the book.

## How it works

### Java folder

- In the src/main/java folder you will find a package named after each design pattern implemented (e.g. \**/com/lucafontanili/designpatterns/abstractfactory/*\*).
- In each design pattern folder you'll find a Client class that implements the *main* method (thus can be executed). Each Client is named following the naming convenction DesignPatternNameClient (e.g. *AbstractFactoryClient*)

### Python folder

- This is pretty similar to the previous one: again you'll find a Client module in each package, that you need to execute in order to see live the behavior of the pattern

## Techs 'n Tools

For this project the following programming languages, IDEs and tools have been used:
- Java 8
- Python 2.7.10
- Eclipse Neon (JavaEE)
- PyDev plugin for Eclipse
- SonarQube
